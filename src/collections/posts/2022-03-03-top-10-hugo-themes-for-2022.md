Building websites with Hugo has a broad appeal to many developers and digital agencies, not least among them the raw speed of the static site generator when it comes to build times and deployment. But what about customizing a site's layout and appearance? That's where Hugo's themes come into play.&nbsp;

## Hugo themes in 2022

Hugo is an immensely popular and well-loved SSG, with an active [Discourse community](https://discourse.gohugo.io/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and a wide range of helpful user guides published almost daily. 2021 saw Hugo’s user base continue to expand, for a range of use cases — among them personal blog sites, documentation, and corporate or e-commerce sites. With [Bookshop support](/blog/live-editing-in-hugo-with-bookshop/) bringing live editing and component-based page building to Hugo, we're sure the SSG will only become more frequently used in 2022.

With such a passionate developer community around Hugo, there are a huge number of themes available, ranging from minimalized and text-centric to design-heavy portfolio, with everything in between. Here, we want to showcase a range of popular and actively developed Hugo themes to help you get started with your latest build as quickly as possible (and with Hugo, that’s pretty quick).

To help speed your decision further, we’ve divided up the Hugo themes below into blog/personal and business/professional categories, with some of their best features outlined.
