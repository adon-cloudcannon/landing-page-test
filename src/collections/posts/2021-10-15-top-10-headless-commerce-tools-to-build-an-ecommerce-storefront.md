The eCommerce industry is growing exponentially. By 2021 alone, the market is projected to reach a total of [$4.89 trillion](https://www.emarketer.com/content/worldwide-ecommerce-will-approach-5-trillion-this-year). This comes after retail eCommerce grew more than [25%](https://www.statista.com/topics/871/online-shopping/#dossier-chapter1) in 2020.

With the quick uptick of the market valuation — due largely to the pandemic — comes the increase of software and tools available to brands to improve their stores. As an eCommerce business owner, the problem then becomes deciding on what technology to choose, or even where to look.

Headless commerce is the most recent tech revolution in the eCommerce industry, and we'll focus more on it in this article. We'll also have a look at some of the best headless eCommerce tools that exist in the market today.

This article will guide merchants and brands looking to build a robust, lean eCommerce tech stack, and it serves as a starting point if you're interested in learning about how to build a modern eCommerce store using CloudCannon as your CMS.

## What is a headless commerce platform?

Headless commerce is a buzzphrase in the eCommerce world, but most people are not aware of its real meaning.

Put simply, headless commerce platforms operate using a headless architecture.

*But what does this mean?*

Headless architecture decouples the software’s frontend and backend, allowing either side (or both sides) to communicate using APIs. With such a powerful platform, users can build customer shopping experiences using the frontend of their choosing, and connect that to backend services like inventory management, discount calculations, pricing, taxation, and other business functions.

Headless commerce platforms are responsible for all the backend services which allow online merchants to easily connect it with multiple frontends, delivering content to websites, mobile apps, smart devices, voice assistants, and digital signage in both online and brick-and-mortar stores.

By contrast, traditional eCommerce solutions have a predefined frontend tightly coupled with the backend, constraining merchants and forcing them to build their storefront using only the templates provided.

## Why do you need a headless CMS for modular eCommerce?

Modular eCommerce is a further extension of headless eCommerce, where each backend service is provided separately to deliver data to frontends using APIs. Instead of having one backend server performing all functions, you now get the flexibility to use any features in the form of microservices.

To take advantage of modular eCommerce to its full capacity, you’ll need a [headless CMS](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/improving-the-headless-cms/) like CloudCannon to serve as the foundation for your digital storefront. Using a headless CMS and an eCommerce platform together enables you to leverage your entire brand to create omnichannel customer journeys. This combination is perfect for high-trafficked brands that can benefit from immense performance improvements compared to using a traditional CMS.

## Benefits of traditional vs. headless commerce

Let’s take a closer look at the benefits of using a headless CMS like CloudCannon for eCommerce, compared to a traditional CMS:

### Omnichannel marketing

Headless commerce allows you to publish content anywhere you need, and allows you the freedom to add publishing destinations in the future. As a brand owner, this helps you sell and publish your content to a variety of channels without worrying about backend functions.

Traditional commerce is mainly built for websites and apps and cannot accommodate the rising needs of businesses to publish content on other modern channels. Even if you try to scale the traditional commerce solution to other channels, it will be expensive and will still remain non-scalable.

### Customization and personalization

With traditional commerce, you are locked into a predefined user experience that restricts your brand from offering personalized product offerings to your customers.

On the other hand, headless commerce has no frontend, so it’s completely up to you to define and develop the user experience from scratch. You can choose to customize the front-end to any degree you choose. As an online brand owner, this helps you create super personalized experiences for users and add localized features.

### Scalability and agility

In a headless approach, the backend and frontend are not tightly coupled with each other. Each component in the backend can speak to different frontends using APIs or [using Git](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/improving-the-headless-cms/). This setup allows you to integrate and communicate with any platform or third-party software. And not only that — it means your system is highly agile, scalable, and flexible enough to support new technologies as they arise.

Traditional commerce, on the other hand, is a tightly coupled system with little to no room for other integrations.

## 10 best headless eCommerce platforms

While choosing an eCommerce platform to facilitate headless architecture, you’ll need to consider many factors, such as:

* API approach
