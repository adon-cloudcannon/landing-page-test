Building a website from scratch can be a rewarding experience. But it can also be a long and taxing process that not everyone can afford to do.

Fortunately, Jekyll has a great catalog of popular, modern themes to choose from and customize, making your life easier — and importantly at no cost.

## Free Jekyll themes in 2022

Jekyll is a well-established, [easy-to-learn](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/) static site generator framework with an active community. It’s also more than just a way to create a simple blog or docs. Minimal or maxed out, blog or business, documentation or design, it’s all there. The community has been working hard over the years to showcase their talent and create some amazing, free themes for many different use cases.

Many of these themes provide a number of powerful features out of the box, such as search, dark mode, and easy API integrations — all great for the age of Jamstack.

Here, we want to show some fantastic, free Jekyll themes that are popular and have seen recent development, to help you get up and running quickly.

To make your decision easier, we’ve divided the themes into blogging/personal and business/professional categories, with some of their best features outlined.
