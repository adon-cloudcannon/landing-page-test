It's great to see the different ways people are using the [Jekyll templates we launched late last year](/announcements/2016/12/05/free-jekyll-templates/). To continue this success, we've put together three new templates ready for your next site. These are licensed under MIT to feel free to use them on client/commercial projects.

## Usage

To use the new templates in CloudCannon, create a new site and select the **Choose a Template** option.

From here you can browse through the templates and select your favourite.

These templates also work without CloudCannon, just fork the template repository on GitHub or download a zip.

## What's Next?

We have more Jekyll templates in the works. If there's a use case a Jekyll template would help you solve let us know in the comments below.
