Today we're announcing two brand-new features which will help you make kick-ass websites.

## Form Submissions

First up is form submissions. Most websites have a contact form for visitors to get in touch. Traditionally, to set up a contact form you'd either have to write a complicated server side script or use an expensive third party service. With CloudCannon, you can set up a normal HTML form on your webpage, then when visitors submit the form the details are automatically sent to the email addresses you specify. Seriously, now you can set up a contact form in under 60 seconds. Have a look at our [documentation for form submissions](https://docs.cloudcannon.com/hosting/contact-forms/) for more details.

## Redirects

We've also added redirects to CloudCannon. When you change the structure of your website you might want the old URLs to redirect to new pages. Now you can set this up on CloudCannon so your website doesn't break for visitors when you start renaming files. Checkout our [documentation](https://docs.cloudcannon.com/hosting/301-redirects/) for more details on how to set this up.

## Documentation

The documentation has been also been completely revamped to make it easier to understand.

We can't wait to see what you create.
