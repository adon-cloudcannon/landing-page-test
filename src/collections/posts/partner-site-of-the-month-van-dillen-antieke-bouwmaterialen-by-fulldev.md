When Van Dillen Antieke Bouwmaterialen \[Antique Building Materials\] began to experience rapid growth with their business model of collecting old building materials for resale, they needed a website to help interested customers see their available materials. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/partner-program/">CloudCannon Partner agency</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://full.dev/">Fulldev</a>, led by Sil Veltman, created a custom design to ensure that Van Dillen’s new website would match the stylish and authentic feeling of their antique materials.

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vdabouwmaterialen.nl/">Van Dillen's new website</a> beautifully showcases the atmospheric construction materials and helps customers reach the team more easily. Built with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> and fully integrated with CloudCannon, the new site makes everything as easy as possible for anyone on the Van Dillen team to update their inventory online.

## Custom design for custom materials

The nature of Van Dillen’s refurnished materials means that every order is unique. And because customers commonly purchase these unique materials for their own homes, personal inspections are still the best way to decide which bricks, tiles, or fittings are most suitable. Rather than functioning as a ‘click and ship’ ecommerce site with online payments, then, Van Dillen’s new website needed to do two main things: showcase the products effectively, and direct customers to a contact form to enable them to inspect the goods in person. To help direct visitors to the contact form, and maximize the results of the new website, Fulldev focussed on delivering an effective custom design.

It was important that the website reflect Van Dillen’s atmospheric construction materials. Fulldev achieved this by creating a custom design system for their new website. This sleek design system features 3 classes for font size, 5 classes for spacing, and predefined color rules. Options were also added for card and section layouts, and the design was built to be responsive to all devices, ensuring a quality experience for all users.

> Van Dillen loved the new website’s style and premium look. The consistent design system makes the website look very professional.

## Easy website updates

Whenever the Van Dillen team restocks their sales yard with new antique construction materials, they also need to make many changes to their website. With a small team, they needed an easy method to change the website content. Veltman knew that by choosing CloudCannon for a CMS, Van Dillen team members would be able to edit their site’s content with ease.

> The CloudCannon interface explains itself; I did not have to explain anything. Clients just understand how to use CloudCannon, which saves me a lot of valuable time.

## Git-based publishing workflow

It’s also important for Van Dillen to be able to make changes to their website without publishing immediately. Fulldev tapped into the power of Git by providing a production branch (for the published website), and a staging branch (for the draft website) on CloudCannon.

Fulldev knew it would be important to offer this feature to ensure the website publishing workflow remains sustainable as the Van Dillen team grows and takes on more business: using a draft or staging website, multiple editors can collaborate on content changes with no risk of bottlenecks.
