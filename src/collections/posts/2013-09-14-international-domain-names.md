We've just pushed a whole heap of changes you're going to love.

### International Domain Names

First up is International Domain name support. We’ve had hundreds of designers making some amazing websites on CloudCannon using their own custom domains. Unfortunately, there have been a few designers who couldn’t use CloudCannon because we didn’t support domain names in their language. Well, fear not, those days are over. We now have full support of [IDN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name).

### Tweaks/Bug fixes

We’re making CloudCannon better everyday, the past few weeks we’ve had a massive focus on improving the usability of the application. Now you’ll see a lot more help text and useful gestures to help you when you get stuck. If you ever get completely stuck or just want a chat, click on the question icon and the top right of the screen and send us a message. We’ll reply as soon as we can.
