**Switching from WordPress to Hugo**

Whether you’re a blogger, marketer, or online business, your website should deliver the best user experience and meet your needs. However, we tend to complicate simple processes in the pursuit of sophistication. ‘*Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication*,’ said Leonardo da Vinci. Although da Vinci never used a website, you can rely on his wisdom to choose between WordPress and Hugo for your site.

**What is the difference between WordPress and Hugo?**

WordPress and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) are platforms with technologies and tools for building and powering sites. But they use different strategies to display pages to visitors on your site. WordPress is a content management system (CMS) that stores your site’s data. When a customer visits your site, WordPress assembles data from its database and processes the content using a template engine to display the page to the visitor.

Hugo is a Static Site Generator ([SSG](https://jamstack.org/generators/)) and does not use databases, servers, or other external data sources. It applies your content to the templates and quickly formats it to display a page to a visitor. This straightforward process can benefit your business in so many ways. If you’re using WordPress for your site, switch to Hugo to enjoy these benefits.

**Why should you switch from WordPress to Hugo?**

To deliver the best experiences and meet your business needs, use a scalable, flexible, easy-to-use, secure, superfast, and affordable platform for your website. Hugo meets all these requirements.

***1\. Superfast Loading Speeds***

Did you know that 53% of online shoppers can abandon a site if it takes [more than 3 seconds](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-ca/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/) to load? You need a superfast website to convert visitors to first-time buyers and loyal customers. Hugo static websites are ten times faster than dynamic WordPress sites. Why? WordPress must build pages every time for each visitor. Hugo stores pre-rendered pages and display them to visitors instantly. Hugo is the fastest SSG and can help you attract and convert more visitors and increase your revenues. You can rely on CloudCannon to switch from WordPress to Hugo and enjoy the benefits of higher sales.

***2\. Scale Up Quickly and Easily***

Opportunities online appear and disappear in an instance. The last thing you need is a slow loading site or unresponsive pages due to a spike in traffic. But scaling dynamic WordPress sites is complex and costly. You’ll have to pay more for servers to process code faster, increase page load speed, and scale up. With Hugo, your site displays the same pages multiple times to meet increased traffic. You can scale up your Hugo site quickly and grab more opportunities ahead of the competition.

***3\. Hassle-free Management***

Maintaining WordPress is tedious, complex, and time intensive. If you’re using a self-hosted site, you have to monitor, manage, or update tons of software and hardware like web servers, plugins, and add-ons. With Hugo, you can host and run your static site on any server that returns HTML files. Once you’ve launched your Hugo site, you can forget about it for a while and focus on growing your business.

***4\. Superior Security***

Your WordPress site has a database with clients’ data or sensitive information, making it a prime target for hackers. This traditional CMS also calls to the server to build and display pages for each visitor. Building pages from various assets opens the door for hackers to inject malicious code, notwithstanding the vulnerabilities that WordPress plugins bring to the ecosystem. When you [switch to Hugo](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/05/switch-wordpress-hugo/), you won’t have to worry about these vulnerabilities and security threats. Hugo doesn’t use databases and servers. It turns your code into secure HTML files, which closes attack vectors and pathways for intrusions.

***5\. Highly Affordable***

Hugo is more affordable than WordPress for many reasons. First, you won’t have to pay for servers and costly databases. Second, Hugo’s superior security means that you won’t need to invest in highly advanced data security solutions. Third, Hugo runs anywhere. So, you can host your site on the most budget-friendly platform.
