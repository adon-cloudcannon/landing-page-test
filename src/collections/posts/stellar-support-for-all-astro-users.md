*3… 2… 1… Ignition. We have liftoff.*

Another week, another static site generator out of beta support on CloudCannon. But it’s not just any SSG — it’s Astro, the [top-performing](https://astro.build/blog/2023-web-framework-performance-report/) all-in-one web framework designed for speed. With Astro and CloudCannon you can manage your content in your own Git repository and deploy everywhere, while using your favorite UI components and libraries. And the final touch? With CloudCannon your highly performant sites are available for non-technical editors to draft, review, and publish their content.

Astro is a lightweight and powerful static site generator that allows developers to mix and match popular frameworks like as React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, SolidJS, AlpineJS, and Lit. Astro keeps your static sites fast by default, automatically converting components to HTML at build time, and removing superfluous JavaScript. And with Astro's partial hydration, you can hydrate specific interactive components on the page.

With CloudCannon as your Astro CMS, your whole team can collaborate to create incredibly fast static sites with a wide range of components. Astro is in fine company on CloudCannon — we’ve recently brought our support for Gatsby, SvelteKit, and Next.js out of beta, joining the likes of Hugo, Jekyll, and Eleventy. (And we’re not stopping there!)

## **What’s new for Astro users on CloudCannon?**

### **Astro-specific documentation and guides**

Experienced Astro devs use it because they love both the tool’s DX and its performance. We’re big fans too, but we also want to support developers who are new to either Astro or CloudCannon. With that in mind, we've updated our documentation to address Astro specifically, to ensure that all of your questions are answered and readily searchable. (If you work across multiple SSGs, you’ll find a handy SSG-switcher in the top right of our new documentation, so you can compare how CloudCannon adapts to different tools.)

We’ve also written up a [Getting Started with Astro](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/guides/astro-starter-guide/) guide, to help you configure your Astro site for for visual editing with CloudCannon, share your Astro site with others, and set up content publishing workflows for large teams.

### **We tested an *astronomical* number of Astro sites**

We have imported, built, and stress-tested a variety of static Astro sites using CloudCannon, from local development using GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket connections to spinning up new Astro sites straight on CloudCannon from one of our existing themes. We've improved the Astro experience for all users along the way.

### **Sendit — a *stellar* free page-building theme for Astro**

We've extended our new theme <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/templates/sendit/">Sendit</a> for Astro as well, demonstrating the benefits of CloudCannon's page-building processes and adaptable Visual Editor for Astro users. Sendit provides a sleek, contemporary, and ready-to-use site that is now available for everyone to adapt, edit, and customize. It’s also an excellent working example of how to configure your existing Astro sites for editing on CloudCannon: make use of that `cloudcannon.config.yml` file and see how it’s all set up!

With Sendit, all users can quickly build their pages from a pre-made set of 20 pre-styled and reusable page components, as well as create their own components to extend the project. Sendit has an easily configurable navigation and footer, multiple hero options, and subtle animations, all optimized for editing in CloudCannon.

Check out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://top-quail.cloudvent.net/">Sendit demo site</a> to see its potential. You can also <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://app.cloudcannon.com/#sites/templates/astro/cloudcannon/sendit-astro-template">deploy a new Sendit site with Astro and CloudCannon</a> in one click, and experience the best of our Visual Editor for intuitive page building.
