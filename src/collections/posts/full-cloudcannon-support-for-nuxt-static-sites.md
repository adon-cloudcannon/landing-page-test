### Introducing "Sendit" — a new free page-building theme for Nuxt

We've extended our theme "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/templates/sendit/">Sendit</a>" to support Nuxt, showcasing the benefits of CloudCannon's page-building processes and adaptable Visual Editor for Nuxt users. Sendit offers a sleek, modern, and ready-to-use website template that is available for everyone to adapt, edit, and customize. It also serves as an excellent example of how to configure your existing Nuxt sites for CloudCannon, with a lot of insights provided in the /`cloudcannon.config.yml` file.

With Sendit, all users can effortlessly create pages from a set of 20 pre-styled and reusable components. Additionally, you can easily customize the navigation, footer, hero options, and subtle animations, all optimized for seamless editing within CloudCannon.

You can explore the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fleek-onion.cloudvent.net/">Sendit demo site</a> to see its potential. Deploying a new Sendit site with Nuxt and CloudCannon takes less than a minute, allowing you to experience the full potential of our Visual Editor for intuitive page building. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://app.cloudcannon.com/#sites/connect/github/cloudcannon/sendit-nuxtjs-template">Try it now!</a>

## Why choose Nuxt?

Nuxt is a highly flexible and popular meta-framework, known for its use of Vue.js for the client-side and its powerful capabilities. For developers who prefer Vue.js components or wish to modernize their websites by migrating from legacy CMS platforms to the static web, Nuxt is an excellent choice.

Why is Nuxt so popular? It’s likely due to its flexibility and speed, giving developers reduced time to interactivity, and improved SEO. When in SSG mode, Nuxt prerenders every route of your application at build time — and with Vite’s build and caching system, build times are dramatically decreased, making Nuxt an attractive option for large static sites.
