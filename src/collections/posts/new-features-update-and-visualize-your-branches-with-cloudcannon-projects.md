We’ve added two new features for users of our advanced branching workflows (Team and Enterprise plans), both aimed at reducing the friction of working with multiple branches.

If you're several branches deep into a [CloudCannon Project](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-project/), you may have found it hard to keep track of which branch is connected to which staging or production site. No more! You can now navigate to the **Publishing** tab on your Project, and you’ll find that we've visualized your branch hierarchy for you:

Being able to see a diagram of your existing branches really helps content teams see where their changes will publish to — and to help speed up edits to any one your branches, each item on the above diagram also acts as a direct link to that specific site.

## Update your sites from upstream sources

On a site level, we've also added the ability to update your branches (pull) from upstream sources — meaning no more out-of-date branches!

<!-- notionvc: 6abea741-5610-423d-826a-e5da9b21d7e3 -->

CloudCannon will now detect when your Publish Branch has been updated. When updates are available, a notification icon automatically appears on the&nbsp;**Publish**&nbsp;button in your&nbsp;**Site navigation**.

When you're working on your site, you can access these optional updates by clicking on **Publish** — if your Publish Branch has been updated since you created your branched site, you'll immediately see the option to pull updates to your branch, and update your site.

*We'll keep working on features for all users of CloudCannon Projects, so let us know if there's more you want to see or do with your branches!*
