### Understanding SOC 2 Type 1 Certification

SOC stands for "Service Organization Control," and is a widely recognized auditing standard, developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

CloudCannon’s SOC 2 Type 1 certification verifies that our security controls, policies, and procedures are designed and implemented effectively. It provides external and independent assurance that we take data security seriously and are actively working to protect sensitive data.
