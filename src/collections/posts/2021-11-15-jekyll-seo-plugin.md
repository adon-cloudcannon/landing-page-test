  SEO is a hot topic for Jekyll and static sites in general. Jekyll has the
  Jekyll SEO tag plugin, which serves a similar purpose. In this showcase, we're
  diving into what the jekyll-seo-tag plugin does and how it works.

    heading: What does the Jekyll SEO plugin do?
    content_markdown: >-
      The plugin is designed to work out-of-the-box with minimal configuration.
      It'll set your page title, description, Canonical URL, next and previous
      pages for paginated
      pages,&nbsp;[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/)&nbsp;structured data to help
      with indexing, Open Graph data for social networks, and Twitter summary
      card.


      The installation is straightforward, simply include the Gem and add {% seo
      %} to the &lt;head&gt; in your layout. The plugin does a good job using
      front matter and configuration data you likely already have set to
      generate the SEO metadata. It'll pick up fields like title, description,
      image & author. For a complete list, check out&nbsp;[the
      docs](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/blob/master/docs/usage.md).


      The result after a build is a block of metadata that looks something like
      this:

      All of that for one line of Liquid and some front matter you probably
      already have set. Yes please. Before this plugin existed, this needed to
      be generated by hand with Liquid. It was error-prone, complicated, and a
      nightmare to maintain. The Jekyll SEO tag plugin almost makes it too easy.

      Let's start by looking at how the HTML is
      generated.&nbsp;[template.html](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/blob/master/lib/template.html){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}&nbsp;is a file with simple
      HTML/Liquid that handles the bulk of the output. A small snippet is
      included here but if you want to dive deeper,&nbsp;[take a look at the raw
      file](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/blob/master/lib/template.html){:

    heading: Liquid Drops
    content_markdown: >-
      The bulk of the plugin is a series of Liquid Drops. You may have heard
      this term before, but what exactly are Liquid Drops? A Drop is similar to
      a Hash in Ruby. It's an object you can use within Liquid with potentially
      dangerous methods removed.


      Let's take the image Drop. All it does is gets an image from a page's
      front matter and returns it as an image path. Most of the logic is
      ensuring the path is in a sane format. Here's a snippet of the file.
      Again,&nbsp;[take a look at the raw
      file](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/blob/master/lib/jekyll-seo-tag/image_drop.rb)&nbsp;for
      a full view.

    content_markdown: >-
      Liquid tags are the logic of a Liquid template, including statements,
      loops, case statements, and more. In this case, the SEO tag ( {% seo %})
      is a Liquid Tag. It's the final piece of the puzzle and what the user
      calls to include the SEO metadata.


      [The
      file](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/blob/master/lib/jekyll-seo-tag.rb)&nbsp;is
      mostly setting up data for the Drops. It ends with registering the SEO tag
      for Liquid:
