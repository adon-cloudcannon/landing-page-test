Do you want to bring something fresh to your Hugo clients? Or perhaps you want to bring the speed and flexibility of Hugo to non-technical users? Look no further. We’ve launched a [new in-depth tutorial over on the CloudCannon Learn pages](/tutorials/bootstrap-to-a-client-editable-hugo-site/)\!

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to take an existing, MIT-licensed Bootstrap template, convert it into a Hugo theme, and then set it up for client editing and rich page-building with CloudCannon and our open-source [Bookshop](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop) tool. You’ll also learn the basics of Hugo navigation, data files, and components, as well as some best practices to ensure that non-technical content editors will be able to make the changes they need, without worrying about breaking the site.

The tutorial uses the Megakit template pictured above ([see demo here](https://demo.themefisher.com/megakit/)) by the talented team at [Themefisher](https://themefisher.com/). It’s a business-style template with drop-down navigation, blog, a wide range of components and best of all, a clean design that can be adjusted to suit your needs.

Once you’ve successfully completed the tutorial for Megakit, you’ll be
well placed to take any Bootstrap template and convert it to a Hugo theme.
Configuring the template for CloudCannon and Bookshop adds a huge amount
of extra functionality for non-technical content editors, including the
ability to browse through a component library for page-building, and live
rendering for instantly intuitive visual editing.

Plus, with CloudCannon all of your site files are stored in your Git
repository, with data, Markdown and HTML files editable by content
editors, and developer-defined staging and publishing workflows for
specific client needs.
