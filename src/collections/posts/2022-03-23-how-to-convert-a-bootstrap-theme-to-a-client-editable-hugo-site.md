      Once you’ve successfully completed the tutorial for Megakit, you’ll be
      well placed to take any Bootstrap template and convert it to a Hugo theme.
      Configuring the template for CloudCannon and Bookshop adds a huge amount
      of extra functionality for non-technical content editors, including the
      ability to browse through a component library for page-building, and live
      rendering for instantly intuitive visual editing.


      Plus, with CloudCannon all of your site files are stored in your Git
      repository, with data, Markdown and HTML files editable by content
      editors, and developer-defined staging and publishing workflows for
      specific client needs.
