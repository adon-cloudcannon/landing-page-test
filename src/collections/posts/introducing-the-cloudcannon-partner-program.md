If you’re building client websites using static site generators, then we’ve got something special for you!

We’re excited to introduce the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/partner-program/">CloudCannon Partner Program</a>. A program built with the help of some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/experts/">outstanding agencies</a>[&nbsp;using CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/experts/)&nbsp;to help make their lives easier.

**We understand agencies** because we run one, too. Our Enterprise Success team works with our enterprise clients, and it gives us a huge range of insights into the challenges of running a web design and development business. Ultimately, that’s why we’ve built this program, to work with our partners to address their challenges:

* How can we reach more new clients?&nbsp;
* How can we keep our current clients happy, so that we get more repeat business from them?
* We’re growing, and our client sites are becoming increasingly difficult to manage.
* We need software that allows us to “set and forget” client websites for a certain amount of time. Reliability is key.
* We never want to receive urgent late-night emails asking us to make changes to a website, but we also don’t want to give our clients too much leeway. Our clients need *just* the right amount of autonomy.
* We’re investing heavily into learning and using this CMS — I wish we had some influence on the future of the product. (A new feature would make our lives a lot easier, or allow us to bring on a big new client!)
* We’re not getting the support we need to help our clients. 72-hour response times and community support isn’t cutting it.

Are you facing any of these challenges? [Join the CloudCannon Partner Program](/partner-program/) — we’re excited to work with you, and grow together!
