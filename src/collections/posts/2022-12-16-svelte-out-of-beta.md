Weâ€™re celebrating the holiday season with another release â€” this time with increased support for SvelteKit users\! With [SvelteKit itself having just reached v1.0](https://svelte.dev/blog/announcing-sveltekit-1.0), this is perfect timing; our build flow now includes SvelteKit's latest stable release.&nbsp;

Our Git-based CMS has already had really solid beta support for SvelteKit for more than a year, and over that time weâ€™ve been quietly working away on improving all aspects of the development and editing experience. Weâ€™re now confident that if you choose to use SvelteKit on CloudCannon, youâ€™ll benefit from the same great developer and editor tooling as you do with other major SSGs like Eleventy, Hugo, and Jekyll.

Itâ€™s safe to say that everyone on our team has their own favorite SSG, and those of us on Team SvelteKit love it for its flexible filesystem-based routing, its simplicity, and its ease of use. We also appreciate SvelteKitâ€™s rapidly growing community of developers, its [busy and helpful Discord community](https://svelte.dev/chat), and its active ecosystem of plugins and tools, offering developers a wealth of resources and support. Finally, for static websites that are heavy on images or other media, SvelteKit just performs *really well*, with plenty of options for optimization and speedy load times. Whatâ€™s not to love?

## Whatâ€™s improved for SvelteKit users?

Weâ€™ve talked about our high bar for support releases when [Eleventy support came out of beta](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/new-eleventy-features-a-new-theme-and-full-eleventy-support/) last week, and the same rules apply here. In order for the whole CloudCannon team to approve this release, we wanted to make sure weâ€™d addressed the following:

### Lots of testing. (*So* much testing.)

Weâ€™ve imported, created, and stress-tested a *very* wide range of SvelteKit sites through all of CloudCannonâ€™s available workflows â€” from local development with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket connections, all the way to spinning up a new SvelteKit site directly on CloudCannon from one of our existing themes. Along the way weâ€™ve improved the SvelteKit experience for everyone.

### Clear documentation and guides

As we stress-test, weâ€™re constantly iterating updating our [documentation for SvelteKit users](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/?ssg=SvelteKit), making sure that all manner of questions are addressed and easily searchable, as well as offering detailed help and advice on configuring your existing SvelteKit sites for use with CloudCannonâ€™s Visual, Content, and Data Editors.

For users who are completely new to SvelteKit and want to try it out, weâ€™ve also created a full [Beginnerâ€™s Guide for new SvelteKit users](/tutorials/sveltekit-beginner-tutorial/) for an easy introduction to layouts, components, templating, blogging and data files. Weâ€™ll continue to build on these tutorials over the coming months.

### Bookshop support for SvelteKit

For users of our open-source component development workflow [Bookshop](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop), weâ€™ve also created a [full reference guide for Bookshop on SvelteKit](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/blob/main/guides/sveltekit.adoc) and a [Bookshop starter template for SvelteKit](https://github.com/CloudCannon/sveltekit-bookshop-starter/). (The Sendit theme comes with Bookshop and a wide range of components already configured, too\!)

## Sendit: A new, free, pagebuilding theme for SvelteKit

{% bookshop "markdown/image" src:"https://cc-dam.imgix.net/blog/blog-eleventy-launch-sendit.jpg" alt:"" extend:false border:false %}

Weâ€™ve released a new free SvelteKit theme called [Sendit](https://cloudcannon.com/community/themes/sendit/) to showcase all the benefits of SvelteKitâ€™s flexibility and CloudCannonâ€™s page-building workflows and responsive Visual Editor in a clean, modern, and ready-to-use site â€” and itâ€™s available now for everyone to use and adapt as they see fit. Check out the [Sendit demo site](https://pleasant-worm.cloudvent.net/) to see whatâ€™s possible.

Sendit has an easily configurable navigation and footer, multiple hero options, and subtle animation, all optimized for editing in CloudCannon.

In less than a minute, anyone can [deploy a new Sendit site with SvelteKit and CloudCannon](https://app.cloudcannon.com/register#sites/connect/github/CloudCannon/sendit-sveltekit-template), and experience the best of our Visual Editor for intuitive page building.

With Sendit, all users can quickly build out their pages from a pre-made set of twenty(\!) pre-styled and reusable page components, as well as create their own components to extend the project.
