With [CloudCannon's support for Eleventy now officially out of beta](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/new-eleventy-features-a-new-theme-and-full-eleventy-support/), there's no better time to investigate a new project. What's the best way to get started? With an Eleventy theme, of course\!

Developers often use themes to save time and to get a head start on building their projects. Though we do tend to use the terms interchangeably, an Eleventy theme or 'starter' is slightly different in scope to a theme, at least as far as the term is used by other platforms. In a legacy CMS like WordPress, a theme is strictly a visual upgrade — set dressing, effectively. An Eleventy theme, by contrast, is usually a pre-configured Eleventy starter project that includes a basic file and directory structure, as well as some initial content and configuration. By using starter projects like this, developers can avoid having to set up a new project from scratch and can instead focus on customizing and building out the features and functionality of their site. (And, if you're using an [Eleventy CMS](https://cloudcannon.com/eleventy-cms/) like CloudCannon, creating the perfect visual editing experience for your site's content editors — or yourself\! See our [Eleventy Setup Tutorial](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/guides/eleventy-cms-get-started-with-cloudcannon/) for more advice on getting started with Eleventy and CloudCannon.)

There's a huge range of free themes available for Eleventy — from simple templates with just a few files to more complex setups with multiple templates, layouts, and preinstalled plugins. Some of the themes I’ve listed below are designed to be minimal and bare-bones, while others include a wide range of features and functionality out of the box. By using a theme, you can choose a project structure and set of features that best fits your needs, and then customize and extend it as needed.

Using a theme can also be a great way to learn about Eleventy and how it works. Many theme include detailed documentation and examples of how to use different features and configurations, which can be helpful for those who are new to Eleventy or static site generators in general. And if you're looking for a more basic [Eleventy tutorial for beginners](/tutorials/eleventy-beginner-tutorial/), we've got you covered.

With that in mind, let's explore a range of popular, new, and niche Eleventy themes for a wide range of use cases.
