We’re incredibly excited to announce the launch of Eleventy support in CloudCannon. Eleventy is the third static site generator we’re offering to our users — and over the past several months, it's also the most frequently requested by the community. With Eleventy alongside Jekyll and Hugo, our goal of becoming the definitive all-in-one platform for Jamstack sites is a step closer.

Now you can sync your Eleventy site from your chosen Git provider, build your site, update your content within an elegant editing environment, and have top-tier hosting on CloudCannon. (And remember, you can find and compare all the Jamstack-compatible tools you'll need for your new and existing sites at our new [Jamstack Ecosystem](https://cloudcannon.com/community/jamstack-ecosystem/) hub.)

## We’re rather pleased about this

We’ve always had the end goal of building the world’s best all-in-one Jamstack platform. We started with full [Jekyll](https://cloudcannon.com/community/learn/jekyll-101/) and [Hugo](https://cloudcannon.com/community/learn/hugo-101/) support, and we’re now picking up speed in adding the rest. With Eleventy support added to CloudCannon, the SSG workflow just got a lot simpler for developers of all skill levels and backgrounds.

## Why Eleventy?

We chose Eleventy for a few key reasons. Firstly, because of Eleventy’s ease of use for a range of skill levels. Sitting in the sweet spot between minimal and flexible, Eleventy is easy to theme and extend, and with its gentle learning curve it’s ideal for beginners to the Jamstack world. Secondly, Eleventy is incredibly flexible in its templating languages: HTML, Markdown, JavaScript, Liquid, Nunjucks, Handlebars, Mustache, EJS, Haml, and Pug. Pick one, or use as many as you want — all within a single project. And like Hugo, Eleventy has extremely fast build times, so even large, complex sites can build in a matter of seconds. Finally, Eleventy connects to CloudCannon’s Git-based CMS simply and efficiently, meaning less time troubleshooting.

## The advantages of using Eleventy and CloudCannon

User-friendly, lean, and high-performance solutions are at the heart of what we do at CloudCannon.

We see Eleventy as a great option for building sites where developer efficiency and low resource usage are the high priorities. You will love Eleventy for its speed and flexibility for collaborative development. Not to mention the learning curve: this is an easy ramp into the SSG and \#leanweb world.

Combined with CloudCannon’s all-in-one platform, you’ll have efficient collaboration within your team, lightning-fast builds, and the best hosting for all of your sites. And, unlike most headless CMSs, CloudCannon is Git-based rather than API-based, so content changes push back to your repository rather than a third-party platform.

## What you can expect

We’ve conducted beta testing with members of the Jamstack community, and we expect to discover some minor issues we need to iron out and workflows that could improve. Our developers are always prepared for these speed bumps, though, so if you find anything, please don’t hesitate to connect with our helpful team.

You can help the community shape support for Eleventy in CloudCannon and make sure it fits your needs; we appreciate all feedback.
