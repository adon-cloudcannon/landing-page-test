What’s that? Another SSG support release for CloudCannon? Absolutely!

We're thrilled to introduce our latest release, which brings CloudCannon's support for Gatsby out of beta. Gatsby is a very popular SSG, due in large part to its use of React for the client-side and GraphQL to access data. For developers using React components, or wanting to bring their data from a legacy CMS to the modern web, Gatsby is an excellent choice.

We’ve been working on enhancing the development and editing experience for all of our customers on Gatsby, and we’re proud to take off that ‘beta’ flag, bringing CloudCannon’s Gatsby support in line with our integration with other leading SSGs, like Eleventy, Hugo, SvelteKit, Next.js, and Jekyll.

Gatsby’s been in the news quite a lot lately — Netlify acquired Gatsby Inc just over a month ago, which will allow for more growth in the Gatsby framework and help cement its status in the static site community. And speaking of community, the Netlify and Gatsby teams have reaffirmed their commitment to open-source, so Gatsby’s rich ecosystem of plugins and integrations will continue to flourish, allowing developers to easily extend its capabilities and integrate with other tools and services. All in all, it’s a great time to be using Gatsby!

## **What’s new for Gatsby users on CloudCannon?**

We set a high standard for this release, as we do for all of our support releases. To ensure that everyone has a positive experience, we’ve made the following changes:

### **All of your Gatsby static sites will be supported**

We have imported, built, and stress-tested a variety of static Gatsby sites using CloudCannon, from local development using GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket connections to spinning up new Gatsby sites straight on CloudCannon from one of our existing themes. We've improved the Gatsby experience for all users along the way.

### **Complete documentation and guides for Gatsby on CloudCannon**

We've updated our Gatsby-specific documentation to ensure that all of your queries are answered and readily searchable, and our support and engineering teams have prepared thoroughly documented advice on configuring your current Gatsby sites for use with CloudCannon's Visual, Content, and Data Editors.

Whether you’re working on page-building; data, content, or visual editing; creating React components or using existing ones; templating; blogging; or using GraphQL data on your CloudCannon Gatsby sites, our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/?ssg=Gatsby">documentation</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/guides/gatsby-starter-guide/">getting started guide</a>, and support will have you covered.

### **Sendit — a new free page-building theme for Gatsby**

We've extended our new theme <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/templates/sendit/">Sendit</a> for Gatsby as well, demonstrating the benefits of CloudCannon's page-building processes and adaptable Visual Editor for Gatsby users. Sendit provides a sleek, contemporary, and ready-to-use site that is now available for everyone to adapt, edit, and customize. It’s also an excellent working example of how to configure your existing Gatsby sites for CloudCannon, so feel free to dig into that `cloudcannon.config.yml` file!

Sendit has an easily configurable navigation and footer, multiple hero options, and subtle animations, all optimized for editing in CloudCannon.
