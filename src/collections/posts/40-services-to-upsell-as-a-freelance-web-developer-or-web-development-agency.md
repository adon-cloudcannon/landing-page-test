  featured_image_alt: 22 services to add value to web development projects
---
Providing more value to your clients is essential to building symbiotic business relationships. Delivering more value to your web development clients can do wonders by making your clients feel understood, and more likely to continue working with you, or your agency in the future. You can deliver more value to your web development clients by offering add-on services, which are suggested to your clients above and beyond the initial project scope.

The guiding principles of suggesting additional services are simple:

* Offer add-ons&nbsp;**after** your client has made a commitment to employ your web development services.
* Only suggest additional services that are relevant to your clients web development project, and business goals.
* Consider bundling your web development services together as a 2-for-1 offer, i.e. offer the additional service at half price with the initial purchase.
* Keep the cost of the additional services lower than the initial web development project's cost.

We’ve put together this handy list of 22 different web development services you can leverage to provide more value to your clients. Just keep in mind that not every service will make sense for every client; always consider which web development add-on services to suggest on a case-by-case basis.

## Website functionality services

### 1\. Content management system (CMS)

Offering your clients a Content Management System (CMS) with an easy-to-use Content Editor for rich-text, and an intuitive Visual Editor for web pages, will be invaluable to both you the developer, and your client. Having a CMS makes it easier for your clients to add new pages to their website, or make changes without needing to contact you for help! We recommend choosing CloudCannon to provide your clients with a customizable <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/for-content-editors/">Content Editor</a>&nbsp;for blog posts or documentation pages, and a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/website-editing/">Visual Editor</a> for live visual editing and page building!

### 3\. Digital asset management (DAMs)

It can be such a pain to spend time uploading images to a website only to find that the file is too large, or the dimensions are incompatible with the website. You can fully eliminate the need for your clients to worry about their site’s digital assets by connecting their website to a Digital Asset Management (DAM) tool. This way the DAM will handle asset optimization for your clients, making their lives easier. You can easily <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/documentation/articles/integrating-your-dam-with-cloudcannon/">connect your DAM of choice to CloudCannon</a>!

If your client’s business operates internationally, or is based in a bilingual (or multi-lingual) location, it makes sense to offer site internationalization as an add-on service. This will make your client's website available in multiple languages! Managing translations on static websites is easier than you think with open-source tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rosey.app/">Rosey i18n</a>. We have created a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/documentation/guides/rosey-migration-guide/">Rosey Migration Guide</a> to help you set up Rosey on CloudCannon.

You can do this on a static website with a booking plugin, or by simply connecting the website to an external booking platform. There are countless industry specific booking platforms out there to choose from; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gettimely.com/">Timely</a>, for example, has found favor in the beauty industry. If you find yourself working on web development projects in an industry specific niche, consider partnering with a well-suited booking platform to earn a commission from the clients you refer.

### 8\. Contact forms

Make it easy for users to contact your clients through their websites by suggesting the creation of contact forms. Providing a site contact form can increase your clients’ leads by making it clear how to get in touch. Here is a list <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/jamstack-ecosystem/contact-forms/">comparing contact form plugins</a> for static websites to help you choose the one that's right for you, and your client.

This way your clients can rest assured that questions will receive a prompt response, and their users will be directed to the appropriate resources without the need for constant monitoring.

### 15\. Web Analytics

Deliver more value to almost any web development client by offering to connect free website analytics tools, like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a>, to their website. This can be easily done through Google Tag Manager or directly in the website’s code. Alternatively, you can earn a commission by referring your clients to paid web analytics providers. Many of your clients may not know how (or why) to use their connected web analytics tools. So as a freelance web developer or agency owner, you can step in to fill this knowledge gap by offering monthly <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/catalog/list?category_ids=6431-google-analytics-4">web analytics reporting</a> as an additional service.
