Upselling is an essential strategy for freelance web developers and web development agencies to increase revenue by delivering more value to clients. If you’ve never heard of upselling before, it involves offering, or rather ‘suggesting’, additional services that are above and beyond the initial purchase or project scope.

McDonald’s has truly mastered the art of upselling with their well-known catchphrase “Would you like fries with that?”, which is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shopney.co/blog/how-mcdonalds-mastered-cross-selling-to-add-15-40-in-revenue-how-you-can-too">estimated to account for a whopping 15-40% of McDonald’s annual profits</a>. The goal of upselling is first and foremost to add value by providing additional benefits and features to clients. Delivering more value to your web development clients can do wonders by making your clients feel understood, and more likely to continue working with you, or your agency in the future. There’s no doubt about it, upselling works! So how can you make upselling work for you, so you can provide greater value to your clients, and make more money as a freelance web developer or web development agency owner?

The guiding principles of upselling are simple:

* Upsell **after** your client has made a commitment to employ your web development services.
* Only suggest additional services that are relevant to your clients web development project and business goals.
* Consider bundling your web development services together as 2-for-1 offer, i.e. offer the additional service at half price with the initial purchase.
* Keep the cost of the additional services lower than the initial web development project cost.

Now you know why and how to upsell your web development services to earn more from each project you or your agency takes on, while building valuable, and long-lasting relationships! But what web development related services should you be upselling?

We’ve put together this handy list of 40 different web development services to upsell to your static website clients. Just keep in mind that not every service will make sense for every client; always consider what web development add-on services to suggest on a case-by-case basis.

## Content management system (CMS) upsells

Upselling your clients a Content Management System (CMS) with an easy-to-use Content Editor for rich-text will be invaluable to both you the developer, and your client. Having a Content Editor makes it easier for your clients to add new pages to their website, or update site copy without needing to contact you for help!

### 5\. Advanced publishing workflow

It doesn’t always make sense to publish a page as soon as it is created. What if it needs to be publicly released at a specific time? Or needs to be reviewed by many stakeholders in-situ before publishing? Offer your clients an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/content-publishing/">advanced publishing workflow</a> by choosing a CMS that easily allows for pages to be set as drafts, with the publishing date and time set in advance! Our team at CloudCannon frequently makes use of drafts and scheduled publishing for our blog. It may seem like a small upsell offering, but the utility cannot be understated!



### 6\. Live preview sites
