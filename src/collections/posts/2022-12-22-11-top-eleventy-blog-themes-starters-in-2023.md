With the new year fast approaching, it’s time for a new-look personal website. But where should you start? We’d recommend Eleventy, the simpler static site generator. If you’re new to Eleventy, be sure to check out our [Eleventy Beginner’s tutorial](/tutorials/eleventy-beginner-tutorial/) to help you get started. If you’d like to get set up with a great Eleventy theme, read on!

## Why use Eleventy themes?

Developers often use themes (also called starters) when working with static site generators like Eleventy to save time and get up and running quickly with a pre-configured project setup. An Eleventy theme is essentially a boilerplate project that includes a basic structure and configuration for a static site, along with some example content and assets. Using a theme can be a helpful way to get started with a new project, especially for developers who are new to Eleventy or static site generators in general.

There are many different themes available for Eleventy, and you can choose one that best fits your needs and preferences. Some are more basic and minimal, while others may include more features and functionality. You can also create your own Eleventy theme by setting up a new Eleventy project and configuring it to your liking, and then sharing it with others as a starting point for their own projects.

## Why start with a blog on Eleventy?

There are many reasons why developers might choose to create a personal blog. Some of the most common reasons include:

**Learning in public**\: Developers often create personal blogs as a way to learn how newly released tools and static site generators work, and to share their knowledge and experience with others in the tech community. This can be especially helpful for other developers who are looking to learn more about a particular programming language or technology.

**Networking**\: Personal blogs can be a great way to network with other professionals in the tech industry. By sharing their thoughts and experiences, developers can build relationships, and promote their skills and expertise to potential employers or clients. By regularly sharing their experiences, developers can demonstrate their growing knowledge and abilities to a wider audience.

**Creativity:** Finally, personal blogs can be a great creative outlet, both in terms of updating their stack to the newest tools, and writing about technical topics.

## CloudCannon’s Top Eleven 11ty Blog Themes

The one that started it all, the Eleventy base blog is also the basis for many other popular themes. If you’re making your first Eleventy blog, this is the theme for you. It’s deliberately minimal, and functions as its own documentation (though the readme at the GitHub source link below is also very helpful).
