      Thanks to [Jamstack](https://cloudcannon.com/Jamstack/), the use cases for static sites are expanding by the day
      and world-leading businesses are choosing static to launch modern,
      high-performing websites. Take a look at our [Community
      Showcases](https://cloudcannon.com/community/showcases/) to see some
      of the incredible things people are doing with static site tech.


      Let's explore why your next project should be static.

    heading: Static versus dynamic websites
    content_markdown: >-
      The difference between a static site and a dynamic site is a little
      technical, but worth understanding. With a dynamic site, the server gets
      the content from a database and builds the page in real time for each
      single visitor. With a static site, the site is pre-built, so when a
      visitor loads a page, the server simply returns a file. This is why static
      websites appear near-instantly, while a typical dynamic site can take
      seconds to appear.

          They deliver a much faster user experience. If you run a
          transaction-driven site, then giving your users a fast experience is a
          key differentiator against your competition.

          They are easier to rank in Google. Google has also recognized the
          importance of speed and favors sites that deliver a fast user
          experience.

          They are inherently more secure, because static sites aren't running
          code on page load.

        content_markdown: >-
          They are easy to develop and maintain. Unlike WordPress sites that
          require endless patches and updates, static sites are inherently
          simple. They just…work.

    heading: Static Site Generators
    content_markdown: >-
      Static site generators (SSGs) address the pain points of dynamic websites,
      while bringing some of the advantages of a dynamic website to the static
      site world. With an SSG and a content management system (CMS) like
      CloudCannon, you can programmatically build static web pages, retrieve
      content from a database or API, use layouts and includes just like on a
      dynamic site. The difference is that an SSG goes through a build process
      that pre-renders all of the pages on the site, meaning that the site
      serves the same page and displays the same information to every person
      viewing it. Any time a developer or content editor changes the site’s
      content or any source files, CloudCannon rebuilds the site, generating an
      entirely new static website for users.

    heading: Building a static site with CloudCannon
    content_markdown: >-
      CloudCannon makes building and maintaining static sites super easy. It
      brings all of the elements you need to build a static site together in one
      place and simplifies the whole process. As with a dynamic site, you still
      need a developer (or an agency) to build your site, but once it’s built
      the process of editing and maintaining the content is very similar.

      To get going, you are going to need either an in-house developer or an
      agency that knows how to develop static sites. If you've got that sorted
      or are a developer yourself, then simply sign up for a [free 14-day
      trial](https://app.cloudcannon.com/register?trial=cc_standard) and
      start building your site.
