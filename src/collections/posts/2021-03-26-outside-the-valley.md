Silicon Valley is often considered the end all be all for startups. The majority of the world's largest tech companies and VC firms are located in the valley, making it a hub for developers and business people who want to make a name for themselves while working on the next big thing.

But it's not the only way to build a start up. CloudCannon is a company which was founded by my co-founder and I in 2013 in the small city of Dunedin, New Zealand. When we started, we didn't know anything about start ups. We didn't have a network of people we could ask for help and had barely ever left New Zealand. What we did have were fresh computer science degrees which gave us the foundation to build quality software, and an urge to create something cool for ourselves and developers worldwide.

Fast-forward to today, and CloudCannon is helping companies from all around the world (including many Silicon Valley companies) build and manage their websites. And it's being done from a small island on the other side of the world\!

We are honored to be included in [Outside the Valley](https://outsidethevalley.tv/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a documentary featuring startups who are making an impact on the world in lesser-known ecosystems. Outside the Valley is created by the award-winning documentary producer & director Hunter Weeks, and J. Ryan Williams, an influential figure in the startup world that has helped take three companies to $100M ARR. It features entrepreneurs from Mexico, Uruguay, Portugal, and New Zealand.

We're really excited to see CloudCannon on the big screen. Thank you to Hunter and Ryan for including us\! Check out the trailer below to see a snippet of our CTO, George, talk about the early days of CloudCannon.
