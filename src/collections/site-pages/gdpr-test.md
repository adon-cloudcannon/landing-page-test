### **What is GDPR?**


The European Union General Data Protection Regulation
2016/679 (**EU GDPR**) is a set of rules enforced on 25th
May 2018. The EU GDPR gives EU citizens more control over
their personal data. It aims to simplify the regulatory
environment for business so both citizens and businesses in
the European Union can fully benefit from the digital
economy.


The United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act 2018 (**UK GDPR**)
is the United Kingdom’s implementation of the EU GDPR.


### **Protecting your data**
