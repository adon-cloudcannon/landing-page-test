  Having that flexibility of having everything live in a Git repository is
  pretty amazing. We don’t have to worry about a separate database, or any other
  pieces in the mix, it’s dead simple. My mentality is to keep things lean and
  as simple as possible; we don’t need anything more. CloudCannon is perfect for
  what we’re doing.
