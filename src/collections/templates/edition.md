  With Edition you can create beautiful documentation for your product or
  service. We use it for the [CloudCannon
  Documentation](http://docs.cloudcannon.com) site which helps us structure
  content into categories. We also see developers creating documentation sites
  for their clients to show them how to update their CloudCannon website.
