### Why the world’s leading streaming platform chose CloudCannon

Sam Harnack, Technical Marketing Director for San Francisco-based live
streaming service Twitch, had a problem.

Twitch’s marketing team relied on a slate of microsites to publish
everything from developer documentation and advertising info to conference
details, learning resources and brand guidelines. These sites were built using
a varitey of technologies including WordPress, Ruby on Rails, and Squarespace which 
 made nobody happy. Developers found them cumbersome to build and
mantain, and spent much of their time supporting marketers with making content changes, 
while the marketers bemoaned the lack of a preview or staging environment and the frequent 
failures of live sites that inevitably followed.

Early in 2017 Harnack, a recent arrival to Twitch, went looking for a
better way. The first step was switching to the Jekyll static site
generator, which was fast, secure and could easily scale to Twitch’s
fast-growing global audience. Next, a new CMS.

### What Twitch needed

The requirements were demanding. It would need to stand up sites quickly,
sharply reduce support requests, offer faultless performance under load,
and support hosting on Amazon AWS infrastructure. The marketing team had
its own shopping list: It needed a CMS it could use with a minimum of
technical know-how and without recourse to developers, and would provide
seamless translation into 27 languages.

Twitch trialled numerous headless CMS but found in each case that they
were too complex in use and that content was disconnected from the live
site.

### The right choice for a fast-moving business

The breakthrough came when CloudCannon was put through its paces. It
quickly matched the specification, allowing editors to write directly
inline and to publish without the assistance of a developer. Importantly,
it integrated with Twitch’s translation workflow to automate the
translation process, letting marketers generate content in English and
then export to human translators via Smartling. The result: frictionless
creation of multiple language versions of Twitch’s marketing sites.

Harnack first transitioned Twitch’s legal pages to CloudCannon and then
made it the default for all the company’s microsites. “CloudCannon
provides a quality editing interface for our marketing team,” he explains,
“while allowing developers to use the tools and workflows they
know.”

to push the pace on providing timely content to their audience.
