When Arid Software co-founder Andrew Ek discovered CloudCannon’s Git-based
CMS, it marked the end of a long discovery process for a client whose web
development project had reached a roadblock.

More than a hundred hours of development work had already gone into the
website project, but while Arid’s client had loved the intuitive WYSIWYG
interface offered by website builders such as Webflow, their project also
needed more sophisticated developer tools in order to achieve fidelity to
their approved design mockups, as well as including the varied types of
content they needed to display.

Andrew had spent hours comparing the features of more than 40 headless
content management systems, hoping to find the perfect CMS, but assuming
that at the very least he would be able to present a reasonable
alternative to his client’s detailed wishlist.

### How CloudCannon ticks all the boxes

Rather than lose the work that had already gone into the project, Andrew
was able to sync his pre-built site in CloudCannon, get it up and running
in minutes, and then add an intuitive visual editing interface for his
non-technical client.

CloudCannon’s Git-based CMS ticked all the boxes that Arid Software was
looking for, with full support for developer interactions, Git support for
version control, and easy two-way Git syncing for collaboration between
Arid’s developers and his client’s content editors.

### Developer-focused support and documentation

Andrew has also found the benefits of CloudCannon‘s world-class support,
with "super responsive" product developers on hand to answer his
questions, and clear documentation for setting up new web projects.&nbsp;

With the wide range of static site generators supported by CloudCannon,
Arid Software is more empowered than ever to do what they do best — create
stunning websites for their clients, and let their clients manage their
own content edits without developer oversight.

### Always adding value for clients

CloudCannon offers significant features for Arid’s clients, at little
additional cost. As Andrew notes, the difference in development time
between creating a basic static site and creating a CloudCannon site with
click-to-edit functionality is very small, but for his clients, there’s a
huge difference in what they can achieve with a site they can edit
themselves.

{% bookshop "markdown/quote" quote:"I'm a big fan of what CloudCannon offers. If I had a client who wanted to assert a brand in a cohesive style, rather than just making use of something out of the box, CloudCannon would be the first thing I'd reach for." %}
