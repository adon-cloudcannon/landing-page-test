### Seeking a better editing experience

Web development agency The New Dynamic (tND) has a
wealth of experience in the Jamstack world, building websites for
organizations large and small. With over 60 years of collective experience
in their leadership team, it's safe to say that tND knows static
sites inside and out &mdash; as well as the services that help site owners
efficiently edit and create new content.

Lead Developer R&eacute;gis Philibert guided
tND&rsquo;s transition to a new content management system for their
clients. After putting CloudCannon through vigorous testing, he came
to the conclusion: for clients who want to upload and edit their own
content, and for developers working with SSGs, "CloudCannon is a better experience."

### Why move to CloudCannon?

Why would a successful agency bring their clients to a new content
management system? And why CloudCannon? Well, tND is always looking for
the best tools, particularly those directly used by their clients. After
investigating CloudCannon, both Régis and tND founder Bud Parr felt it was
time to transition to a new Git-based CMS. And CloudCannon developers work
closely with tND, too — CloudCannon’s roadmap is driven forward by an
experienced team of devs who follow customer feedback from both developers
and content managers: the people who interact with the content management
system every day.

As for Régis, who’s put CloudCannon through its paces, how does he feel about the process of actually transitioning clients to a new CMS? 

{% bookshop "markdown/quote" quote:"I'm in a position to be confident; there's not much
impact on the code itself — most of the content \[changes are\] in config
files and a few form fields, but that's it. We’re very confident." %}

Looking at CloudCannon from a client’s perspective (“stepping into the
shoes of an editor”, as he puts it), Régis is particularly impressed with
the UX.

Working together with CloudCannon as the CMS adds more features for
developers and content editors alike, Régis and The New Dynamic team will
be able to bring the best Jamstack editing to more and more people.

And with every site tND creates, and every additional content editor
taking the reins of their own site, tND will be more empowered to do what
they do best: research, design, and develop the best possible websites.


{% bookshop "markdown/quote" quote:"The fact that you can preview links, the way that you choose your images,
      those kinds of things are really helpful to editors. And when
      you add content to a page just like a page builder, you can click on any
      one of those blocks and see all of its styles and its content. That's
      pretty powerful. As an overall product, it's very cool." %}
     
## An agency that takes responsibility

As a Lead Developer, Régis spends a lot of his time on research and
development. This includes finding new frameworks for tND’s client sites,
building Hugo modules for new and potential clients, and, in the case of
CloudCannon, figuring out how best to adapt sites for a new CMS to
surpass client expectations.

Régis spends a lot of his time working on Hugo logic for tND clients, but
he also maintains [HUGE](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/huge), the
open-source framework that allows users to make Hugo even more declarative
in its configuration. Alongside these responsibilities is the popular Hugo
theme [Ananke](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke),
created by Bud Parr. In addition to founding the agency itself, Bud also
created the influential [tND
community](https://www.thenewdynamic.com/community-and-events/),
where hundreds of Jamstack developers, dev advocates, and community
members congregate — it’s clear that tND is a major player in the Jamstack
world.

One of the core technologies that tND works with, aside from Jamstack, is
Git-based content. Having multiple clients with existing sites served from
Git repositories, tND depends on a Git-based CMS with intuitive editing
capabilities, a reliable roadmap for the future, and excellent
support.

CloudCannon offers exactly that, with dedicated support for agencies
handling multiple sites, meaning fewer headaches for Régis and the tND
team going forward. Régis has already found CloudCannon’s support team —
led by its product developers — to be “super helpful” in their approach to
feature requests, workarounds, and ready explanations, leaving him
thrilled with the CMS as a whole.

One website that R&eacute;gis and tND have already moved to CloudCannon
is [AGNI Online](https://agnionline.bu.edu/), a literary
journal from Boston University with a proud fifty-year history of
publishing new poetry, fiction, essays, interviews and criticism &mdash;
and thousands of files and site pages to show for it.

AGNI had originally used WordPress, and tND transitioned their site and
its original design to CloudCannon’s Git-based CMS, avoiding the constant
maintenance cycle so common to WordPress sites.


With CloudCannon’s Content Editor and tND’s efficient development, AGNI
editors can easily add new content and upload new media, and they can do
all of this content management themselves — without incurring additional
development costs every time the contents of a new issue need to be
uploaded.


And with the benefits of Jamstack — speed, reliability, and security —
AGNI readers have the best possible experience.

{% bookshop "markdown/quote" quote:"We’re eager to port those sites to CloudCannon, to show it to our clients,
      to discuss it, and get them set up. We're very happy, and I'm thrilled to
      have more clients seeing their sites on CloudCannon." %}

### Empowered editors without a developer
   
It’s not just multi-author magazines that tND’s looking forward to
bringing to CloudCannon, either: some of tND’s clients are large financial
companies, with high-priority quarterly reports and publications.

Because these companies need to make major edits to their websites on a
regular basis, CloudCannon’s branching workflows for content editors are
another compelling reason to make the switch.

Rather than freezing a site while the changes are being made, editors on
CloudCannon are able to create their own branches for the upcoming
financial quarter, and can then make, review, and approve all of their
edits in one place — a private staging site.

Their existing site can then stay live until they're completely happy with
their new content. At this point they'd be able to simply publish all
their new changes from their private staging site to their public
production site at the precise time they wish to release their new reports
— all without involving a developer.

{% bookshop "markdown/quote" quote:"Our users are able to make all of their changes and see them happening on
      the preview that is shown by CloudCannon, without actually publishing all
      their changes. So this allows them to do a batch of changes
      without having any impact until they hit that publish button. It's a very
      simple way to do it, but it's better for editors." %}
 

### Better editing, happy clients

CloudCannon has recently implemented a range of features that have
solidified R&eacute;gis&rsquo;s confidence in the CMS: from global input
and schema settings to DAM support, any gaps between tND&rsquo;s previous
CMS and CloudCannon have been bridged.

And with the CloudCannon team consistently working on new and requested features from
their users, the future looks bright for devs and content editors
alike.

As a developer who's very much aware of what content editors
appreciate, R&eacute;gis can already see that tND&rsquo;s clients are
going to be very happy with their CloudCannon sites in the long term.
