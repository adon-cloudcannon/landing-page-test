              ## What is GDPR?


              The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a set of rules
              enforced on 25th May 2018. The GDPR gives EU citizens more control
              over their personal data. It aims to simplify the regulatory
              environment for business so both citizens and businesses in the
              European Union can fully benefit from the digital economy.


              ## Protecting your data


              CloudCannon is committed to to comply with all GDPR requirements.
              We've added internal procedures and security measures to ensure
              your data remains protected.

              relating to any Personal Data (**Data Subject
              Request**).&nbsp;&nbsp;

              ##### 5\.&nbsp; OUR PERSONELL


              5\.1.&nbsp; We will:


              a. &nbsp;take reasonable steps to ensure the reliability of any of
              our Personnel engaged in the Processing of Personal Data;


              b. &nbsp;ensure that access to Personal Data is limited to our
              Personnel who require that access as strictly necessary for the
              purposes of exercising our rights and performing our obligations
              under the Terms;


              c. &nbsp;ensure that our Personnel engaged in Processing Personal
              Data are subject to confidentiality undertakings or professional
              or statutory obligations of confidentiality; and


              d. &nbsp;ensure that our Personnel engaged in Processing Personal
              Data are informed of the confidential nature of the Personal Data
              and receive appropriate training on their responsibilities.


              5\.2. &nbsp;We have appointed a data protection officer who can be
              contacted at privacy@cloudcannon.com.


              ##### 6\.&nbsp; SUBPROCESSORS


              6\.1.&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that we may engage third
              party Sub-Processors in connection with the provision of the
              Service.


              6\.2.&nbsp; We have entered into (and will, for any new
              Sub-Processor, enter into) written agreements with each
              Sub-Processor containing data protection obligations which offer
              at least the same level of protection for Personal Data as set out
              in this Addendum and that meet the requirements of Article 28(3)
              of the GDPR, as applicable to the nature of the services provided
              by that Sub-Processor.


              6\.3.&nbsp; You may request copies of our written agreements with
              Sub-Processors (which may be redacted to remove confidential
              information not relevant to this Addendum).&nbsp;


              6\.4.&nbsp; A list of current Sub-Processors for the Service as at
              5/5/2021 is set out in Schedule 2.&nbsp; We may update the list of
              Sub-Processors from time to time and, subject to clause 6.5, we
              will give at least 14 daysâ€™ written notice of any new
              Sub-Processor (**Change Notice**).&nbsp;&nbsp;


              6\.5.&nbsp; We may engage Sub-Processors as needed to serve as an
              Emergency Replacement to maintain and support the Service.&nbsp;
              \*Emergency Replacement \*means a sudden replacement of a
              Sub-Processor where a change is outside our reasonable
              control.&nbsp; In this case, we will inform you of the replacement
              Sub-Processor as soon as reasonably practicable.&nbsp;


              6\.6.&nbsp; You may object to any new Sub-Processor on reasonable
              grounds by notifying us within 10 days of receipt of a Change
              Notice.&nbsp; Your notice of objection to any new Sub-Processor
              must explain the reasonable grounds for your objection.&nbsp; The
              parties must discuss your concerns about the new Sub-Processor in
              good faith with a view to resolve the objection to the use of the
              new Sub-Processor in a commercially reasonable manner.&nbsp; If it
              is not possible to resolve the objection, and we do not revoke the
              Change Notice before the date the Change Notice takes effect, you
              may, despite anything to the contrary in the Terms, terminate the
              applicable Service under the Terms that cannot be provided to you
              without that new Sub-Processor.&nbsp; If you do not terminate the
              relevant Service under the Terms in accordance with this clause,
              you are deemed to have agreed to the new Sub-Processor.


              6\.7.&nbsp; We are liable for the acts and omissions of our
              Sub-Processors to the same extent we would be liable if performing
              the services of each Sub-Processor directly under the terms of
              this Addendum, except as otherwise set out in this Addendum.


              ##### 7\.&nbsp; SECURITY


              We will maintain technical and organizational measures to protect
              the confidentiality, integrity and security of Personal Data
              (including protection against unauthorized or unlawful Processing
              and against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration
              or damage, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Personal
              Data), and to manage data security incidents affecting Personal
              Data, in accordance with Appendix 2 of the Standard Contractual
              Clauses.&nbsp;&nbsp;


              ##### 8\.&nbsp; SECURITY BREACH MANAGEMENT


              8\.1.&nbsp; We will comply with all applicable laws requiring
              notification to you of any accidental or unlawful destruction,
              loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to
              Personal Data Processed by us or our Sub-Processors of which we
              become aware (**Breach Incident**).&nbsp;&nbsp;


              8\.2.&nbsp; We will make reasonable efforts to identify the cause
              of that Breach Incident, notify you within a timely manner to
              allow you to meet your obligations to report a Breach Incident,
              and take steps we consider necessary and reasonable to remediate
              the cause of the Breach Incident, to the extent remediation is
              within our reasonable control.&nbsp;


              ##### 9\.&nbsp; AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE


              Upon your written request, we will, at your cost, submit to your
              audits and inspections, and provide you all information necessary,
              to demonstrate that both you and we are complying with our
              respective obligations under Applicable Data Protection Laws
              (including our respective obligations under Article 28 of the
              GDPR).


              ##### 10\.&nbsp; DATA PROTECTION IMPACT ASSESMENT


              Upon your written request, we will, at your cost, provide you with
              reasonable assistance needed to fulfil your obligation under
              Applicable Data Protection Laws to carry out a data protection
              impact assessment relating to your use of the Service, to the
              extent you do not otherwise have access to the relevant
              information.


              ##### 11\.&nbsp; RETURN AND DELETION OF PERSONELL DATA


              11\.1.&nbsp; Subject to clauses 11.2 and 11.3, following
              termination of the Terms we will delete all Personal Data within a
              reasonable period from termination of the Terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;


              11\.2.&nbsp; Subject to clause 11.3, you may submit a written
              request to us within 10 working days of the termination of the
              Terms requiring us, within 20 working days of your written
              request, to:


              a. &nbsp;return a complete copy of all Personal Data by secure
              file transfer in a common format; and


              b. &nbsp;delete all other copies of Personal Data Processed by us
              or any Sub-Processor.&nbsp;


              11\.3.&nbsp; We, or each Sub-Processor, may retain Personal Data
              to the extent that it is required by applicable laws, provided
              that we ensure the confidentiality of all such Personal Data and
              ensure that such Data is only processed as necessary for the
              purposes required under applicable laws requiring its Processing
              and for no other purpose.&nbsp;


              11\.4.&nbsp; If we cannot delete all Personal Data due to
              technical reasons, we will inform you as soon as reasonably
              practicable and will take reasonably necessary steps to:


              a. &nbsp;come as close as possible to a complete and permanent
              deletion of the Personal Data;


              b. &nbsp;fully and effectively anonymize the remaining data; and

              12\.1.&nbsp; We may on at least 30 days' written notice to you
              from time to time, make any variations to this Addendum (including
              to the Standard Contractual Clauses), which we consider (acting
              reasonably) are required as a result of any change in, or decision
              of a competent authority under, Applicable Data Protection Laws,
              to allow transfers and Processing of Personal Data to continue
              without breach of Applicable Data Protection Laws.


              12\.2.&nbsp; If you object to any variation under clause 12.1 on
              reasonable grounds, you may, despite anything to the contrary in
              the Terms, terminate these Terms and your right to access and use
              the Service without penalty on written notice, provided your
              notice of termination is received by us before the effective date
              of our notice.&nbsp; If you do not terminate these Terms and your
              right to access and use the Service in accordance with this
              clause, you are deemed to have agreed to the variation.&nbsp;


              ##### 13\.&nbsp; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY


              The liability of each party to the other party under or in
              connection with this Addendum is subject to the limitations and
              exclusions set out in the Terms, and any reference in the Terms to
              the liability of a party means the aggregate liability of that
              party under the Terms and this Addendum together.


              ##### 14\.&nbsp; GENERAL


              If any provision of this Addendum is, or becomes unenforceable,
              illegal or invalid for any reason, the relevant provision is
              deemed to be varied to the extent necessary to remedy the
              unenforceability, illegality or invalidity.&nbsp; If variation is
              not possible, the provision must be treated as severed from this
              Addendum without affecting any other provisions of this Addendum.
