              Only critical vulnerabilities that demonstrate complete compromise
              of the systemâ€™s integrity or confidentiality are eligible for a
              bounty. While we encourage you to submit all potential issues,
              lower severity issues are not in scope at this time.


              Itâ€™s important to keep in mind that not all submissions will
              qualify for a bounty, and that the decision to award a bounty is
              entirely at the discretion of CloudCannon. CloudCannon have the
              final decision on which issues constitute security
              vulnerabilities.

              **Do**\:


              * Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential
              security issue, and weâ€™ll make every effort to quickly resolve the
              issue.

              * Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations,
              destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our
              service.

              * Making many substantially similar reports will only be eligible
              for one bounty award, and marked as duplicate. For example, the
              same vulnerability reported across multiple sub-domains. Please
              consolidate issues into a single report.


              **Donâ€™t**\:


              * Do not make any information public until the issue has been
              resolved.

              * Do not access or modify data that does not belong to you -
