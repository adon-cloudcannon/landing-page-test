              ## Compliance


              CloudCannon has SOC 2 Type 1 compliance and is working towards SOC
              2 Type 2.


              For payments we use Stripe, which is a certified Level 1 Service
              Provider. CloudCannon does not store any raw payment details.


              ## GDPR


              CloudCannon works hard to ensure the app is GDPR compliant. For a
              list of subprocessors you can review our [GDPR policy](/gdpr/).
              Once an account, site, or project is removed, all associated data

              ## Privacy


              Your privacy is critically important to us. At CloudCannon we have
              a few fundamental principles:


              * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need
              it.


              * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to
              comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.


              * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless
              required for the on-going operation of one of our services.


              Read more in our [privacy policy](/privacy/) and if you have any
              concerns, please share them with us.


              ## Technical and organizational measures


              CloudCannon implements several measures to maintain high standards
              of security, availability and confidentiality. Those measures
              include but are not limited to:


              * Use of leading cloud-infrastructure partners AWS and Cloudflare
              services that comply with security policies and frameworks.


              * DDoS protection tools.


              * Encryption: all network traffic is encrypted using TLS and all
              the data is encrypted at rest.


              * Continuous automated vulnerability scans with remediation
              timeframes.


              * External penetration testing.


              * Implemented intrusion prevention and anomalous and suspicious
              activity detection systems.


              * Maintained and periodically tested disaster recovery and
              business continuity plans.


              * Complete development, testing and production environment
              separation.


              * Applied secure lifecycle development and secure engineering
              practices.


              ## External pen testing and responsible disclosure policy


              CloudCannon hires a 3rd party to run penetration tests at least
              annually. We use scanning tools to monitor and detect
              vulnerabilities. We also run a [Bug Bounty Program](/bug-bounty/);
              activity and submissions should follow the stipulated guidelines.
