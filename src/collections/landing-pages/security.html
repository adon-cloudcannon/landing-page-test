              At CloudCannon, security is important to us. We are always looking
              for ways to improve our product and a big part of that is
              security. This includes our product and the way our people conduct
              themselves to achieve the entire experience.


              ## Compliance


              CloudCannon is currently working towards SOC2 compliance as a
              priority for 2023. In the meantime, Enterprise customers can work
              directly with our Information Security team.


              For payments we use Stripe which is a certified Level 1 Service
              Provider. CloudCannon does not store any raw payment details.


              ## GDPR


              CloudCannon works hard to ensure the app is GDPR compliant. For a
              list of subprocessors you can review our [GDPR policy](/gdpr/).
              Once an account, site or project is removed, all associated data
              are immediately removed.


              ## Privacy


              Your privacy is critically important to us. At CloudCannon we have
              a few fundamental principles:


              * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need
              it.

              * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to
              comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

              * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless
              required for the on-going operation of one of our services.


              Read more in our [privacy policy](/privacy/) and if you have any
              concerns, please share them with us.


              ## Technical and organisational measures


              CloudCannon implements several measures to maintain high standards
              of security, availability and confidentiality. Those measures
              include but are not limited to:


              * Use of leading cloud-infrastructure partners AWS and Cloudflare
              services that comply with security policies and frameworks.

              * DDoS protection tools.

              * Encryption: all network traffic is encrypted using TLS and all
              the data is encrypted at rest.

              * Continuos automated vulnerability scans with remediation
              timeframes.

              * External penetration testing.

              * Implemented intrusion prevention and anomalous and suspicious
              activity detection systems.

              * Mantained and periodically tested disaster recovery and business
              continuity plans.

              * Complete development, testing and production environment
              separation.

              * Applied secure lifecycle development and secure engineering
              practices.


              ## External pen testing and responsible disclosure policy


              CloudCannon hires a 3rd party to run penetration tests at least
              annually. We use scanning tools to monitor and detect
              vulnerabilities. CloudCannon runs a bug bounty program. [The Bug
              Bounty Program](/bug-bounty/) is currently available; it is
              important to follow the guidelines stipulated.
