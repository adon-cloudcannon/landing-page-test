description: An overview of the editing interfaces available on CloudCannon.
---

There are four ways to manage content on CloudCannon: the [Visual Editor](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/introducing-the-visual-editor/), [Content Editor](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor/), [Data Editor](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/introducing-the-data-editor/), and the [Source Editor](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/introducing-the-source-editor/). Each editing interface is useful in different situations.

### The Visual Editor

[The Visual Editor](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/introducing-the-visual-editor/?ssg=Hugo) is the most intuitive way to edit content on CloudCannon. Editable elements are indicated with a yellow box. Editors can click on the element and add their new content, directly on the page.

 The Visual Editor also features a sidebar for managing front matter content. You can customize these inputs to give your editing team a more intuitive interface. For example, showing a date picker for a date field, adding a small comment to indicate how a field is used, or using a select box to reference other pages on the site or data in a data file.

We’ll go deeper into how to configure CloudCannon later in this guide, or if you want to skip ahead, read through the documentation on [Customizing your inputs](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/how-to-choose-what-input-is-used-in-the-data-editor/).

### Content Editor

[The Content Editor](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor/?ssg=Hugo) is a rich text editor for Markdown files. It’s useful if you want a distraction-free, clean writing interface. It’s particularly useful for blog posts and other content with a simple layout. Note that the Content Editor view also shows the Data Editor in the left-hand panel, as pictured below.

### Data Editor

We’ve already seen the [Data Editor](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/introducing-the-data-editor/) — it’s the side bar for managing front matter in the Visual and Content Editor. The Data Editor is also used to manage content in YAML, TOML, JSON, CSV, and TSV files.

### Source Editor

[The Source Editor](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/introducing-the-source-editor/?ssg=Hugo) is an in-browser code editor which is great for make small, quick changes. As with all the Editors, any changes sync back to your Git repository.
