## Hosting

CloudCannon is an all-in-one CMS with hosting included. Every site gets their [own .cloudvent.net domain name](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/viewing-your-site-on-a-testing-domain/?ssg=Hugo) hosted on a blazing fast CDN backed by CloudFlare. For a production site, you can [point your own domain at your site](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/hosting-your-site-on-a-custom-domain/?ssg=Hugo) or use [CloudCannon DNS](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/using-cloudcannon-dns-to-configure-your-custom-domain/?ssg=Hugo) to automate the set up.

All sites get an SSL cert, scale to meet any traffic demands, can have [custom routing and headers](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/configuring-custom-routing/?ssg=Hugo#custom-headers), [handle form submissions](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/getting-started-with-forms-on-cloudcannon/?ssg=Hugo), and [a variety of authentication options](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/adding-password-authentication-to-your-site/?ssg=Hugo).
