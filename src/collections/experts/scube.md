      Breeze is a website migration tool that helps website managers to keep
      track of their work and migrate easily.


      They want to portray and market their tools online by using a website. We
      helped the client by creating a website using gatsbyjs.


      We created the site by using templates to allow the client to make their
      own changes within the CMS without the help of a developer coding.
