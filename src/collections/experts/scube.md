      Breeze is a website migration tool that helps website managers to keep
      track of their work and migrate easily.


      They want to portray and market their tools online by using a website.
      We helped the client by creating a website using gatsbyjs.


      We created the site by using templates to allow the client to make
      their own changes within the CMS without the help of a developer
      coding.
