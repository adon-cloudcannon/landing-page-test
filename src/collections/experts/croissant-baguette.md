      Fiducian is an ASX-listed diversified financial group. Requirements
      included a modern look and simplified UI, both for the front and back end.


      We designed and developed a custom drag-and-drop "block format" site to
      allow the internal team to make updates while keeping the design
      integrity. The site scores 99% on GTmetrix despite its massive size.

      EdTripper’s MVP looks simple on the surface, but is packed with features.


      Developed with Sveltekit, EdTripper allows the user to search and book
      attractions and tour programs across Australia. The app is inspired by
      Airbnb for the search and map function, and includes user dashboards.
      EdTripper scores a 99% on GTmetrix despite its complexity.
